 - Update user-facing docs and internal notes so they match reality.
 - Record factual progress in `clearance_and_connect_tasks_documentation.md` (see that file for the logging template)
 immediately after work is verified. If work is attempted but blocked, log the block instead of
 claiming completion.
 - Submit or link to evidence (commits, screenshots, test runs) in the central log—again, only for work that actually
 happened.
